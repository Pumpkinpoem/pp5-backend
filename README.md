## Color Scheme

### Color Palette

For this project, I have selected a cozy and inviting color palette to align with the brand identity, which is focused on book clubs and creating a comfortable, easy-on-the-eyes experience.

#### Primary Colors:

![Color Scheme](../pp5-backend/frontend/src/assets/color_scheme_with_hex.png)

- **Light Moss Green (#CBDFBD):** A soft, soothing green that serves as the main background color, providing a calming atmosphere.
- **Soft Buttercream (#F6F4D2):** A gentle off-white used for borders, adding a warm contrast without being too harsh.
- **Chestnut (#A44A3F):** A rich, warm color used for primary text, ensuring excellent readability against the lighter backgrounds.
- **Light Sage (#D4E09B):** A light, creamy color used for secondary text, keeping the design soft and easy to read.
- **Peachy Coral (#F19C79):** A vibrant orange used sparingly for accent elements like buttons and links, drawing attention without overwhelming the user.

### Analogous Colors

In color theory, an **analogous** color scheme involves colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. These colors usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. The analogous scheme used here incorporates shades of green, yellow, and orange to achieve a harmonious and welcoming look that resonates with the warmth and community spirit of book clubs.

## Testing

### Automated

I tried to set up aoutomation but i kept getting ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined
and it whas never explained in the lessions on how to handle difrent type of set up errors 

### Manual

Testing was ongoing throughout the development process. Chrome Dev Tools was used during the building to test the responsiveness and interactions. The deployed website is tested on Chrome, Opera GX, and Samsung S22 Ultra.
The site looks and works as intended.

- **Navbar/Links/Buttons:** Each link on the Navbar and pages works without any problem, same with the buttons. Rendering and navigation work as intended and expected.

- **Auth/Access:** Both the sign-in and sign-up forms work without problems. The request and redirecting send you to the correct pages.

Only users that have an account and are logged in have access to adding posts, and they can only edit/delete the posts and comments they've posted. They only have access to edit their own profile, username, and password.
Only logged-in users can post/edit/delete comments, like others' posts (not their own), and follow/unfollow other profiles.

## Credits

### Code

- Followed along the walkthrough projects "Moments" and "Django REST Framework" by Code Institute while making this project.

### Content

- All user accounts that exist at this moment where created by me.

### Media

- All images posted and profile pictures used by the users are AI generated from [Leonardo AI](https://app.leonardo.ai) and [Aitubo](https://aitubo.ai/).
- Favicon is a custom logo made in [Leonardo AI](https://app.leonardo.ai).
- I borrowed the icons and burger menu from the walkthrough "Moments", as I liked the look of them.
